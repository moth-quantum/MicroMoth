# MicroMoth for TouchDesigner
This version of MicroMoth is introduced as a TouchDesigner operator (node) file. A Custom Op is based on TouchDesigner's C++ API. The directory has a name of the operator (e.g. `MicroMothTOP`) and includes `.h` files, `.cpp` files or sometimes, `.sln` and `.vcxproj` files if it's developed upon Visual Studio (for Windows).

The location of the customised TouchDesigner operators is underneath this directory:
- Mac: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Derivative/TouchDesigner099/Plugins`
- Windows: `C:/Users/<username>/Documents/Derivative/Plugins` (Just an example)
