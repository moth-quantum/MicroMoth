# MicroMoth for Arduino
This version of MicroMoth is tested with Arduino Mega 2560.

## Setup
Make an Arduino project, and inside of the directory where `{YourProject}.ino` is stored, bring both `MicroMothArduino.h` and `MicroMothArduinoMath.h` to the same path.

And don't forget to add `#include "MicroMothArduino.h"` on your `.ino` file!

That's it! Enjoy.

c.f. An example of MicroMoth for Arduino in use can be seen in MicroMothArduino.ino.
